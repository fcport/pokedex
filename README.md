# Pokedex

This is a project I made for my front-end Angular portfolio, I have used [Bootstrap 5](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home), and [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

I'll keep updating this as I'll be learning new things ( *you never stop learning* ).

## This project is deployed!

You can have a quick look (or a long look, if you have fun) of this app [here](https://pokedex-remastered.herokuapp.com/). 

## Made with Angular (and love)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
